# Title: CES Albania Web Application - Online Financial Services and LMS Platform 
## Project Overview
CES Albania is the company that I was assigned to develop by the ConnectIT project in the framework of Software Engineering subject. This company has an already existing web application, but it was not functional. My aim was to redesign and implement an LMS platform and make this site funstional and this is what my software engineering project is about. The project involves developing a comprehensive online platform for CES Albania to offer financial services, accounting solutions, and an LMS platform. The platform will enable users to access various financial services, enroll in online courses, and connect with industry professionals. The project will be executed using an Agile development model, allowing for iterative development, frequent feedback, and continuous improvement.

## Abstract
This Software Engineering project aims to develop an online platform for CES Albania, a financial services company, to provide a range of services including financial solutions, accounting services, and a Learning Management System (LMS) for practical learning and connecting students with job opportunities.
